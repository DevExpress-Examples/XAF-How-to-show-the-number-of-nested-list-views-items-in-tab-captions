# XAF - How to show the number of a nested ListView's items in tab captions

In this example, we demonstrate how to show the number of nested ListViews' items in tab captions. This is done in the platfrom-dependent controllers: the [EmployeeDetailViewWinController.cs](./DetailViewTabCount/WinForms/CS/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Win/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewWinController.cs) for the WinForms application, the [EmployeeDetailViewWebController.cs](./DetailViewTabCount/ASP.NET/WebForms/CS/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Web/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewWebController.cs) for the ASP.NET WebForms application, and the [EmployeeDetailViewBlazorController.cs](./DetailViewTabCount/ASP.NET/Blazor/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Blazor/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewBlazorController.cs) for the ASP.NET Core Blazor application. For implementation details, refer to the following links:
