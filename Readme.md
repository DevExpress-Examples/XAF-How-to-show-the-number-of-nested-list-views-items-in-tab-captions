# XAF - How to show the number of nested List View items in tab captions

In this example, we demonstrate how to show the number of nested List View items in tab captions. This is done in the platform-dependent controllers: [EmployeeDetailViewWinController.cs](./DetailViewTabCount/WinForms/CS/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Win/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewWinController.cs) for WinForms applications, [EmployeeDetailViewWebController.cs](./DetailViewTabCount/ASP.NET/WebForms/CS/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Web/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewWebController.cs) for ASP.NET WebForms applications, and [EmployeeDetailViewBlazorController.cs](./DetailViewTabCount/ASP.NET/Blazor/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Blazor/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewBlazorController.cs) for ASP.NET Core Blazor applications. For implementation details, refer to the following links:

* [ASP.NET WebForms](./DetailViewTabCount/ASP.NET/WebForms) 
* [ASP.NET Core Blazor](./DetailViewTabCount/ASP.NET/Blazor)
