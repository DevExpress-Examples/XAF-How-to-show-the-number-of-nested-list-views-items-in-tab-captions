# XAF - How to show the number of a nested ListView's items in tab captions

In this example, we demonstrate how to show the number of nested ListViews' items in tab captions in ASP.NET Web Forms applications. This is done in the platfrom-dependent controller: [EmployeeDetailViewWebController.cs](./CS/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Web/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewWebController.cs). Follow the steps listed below to accomplish this task:
1. Create a controller in the WebForms module project.
2. In the **Properties** window for the controller, set the **TargetViewType** property to the **DetailView** and the **TargetObjectType** to your business object type. As a result, the controller will only be activated in detail forms for your business objects.
3. In the **OnActivated** method, set the [CompositeView.DelayedItemsInitialization](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.CompositeView.DelayedItemsInitialization) to **false** to initialize all View Item controls immediately when the Detail View is created. This will allow you to obtain the number of ListView items.
4. In the same method, handle the [View.ControlsCreated](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.View.ControlsCreated) event. In the created event handler, you can handle the [ASPxGridView.DataBound](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxDataWebControlBase.DataBound) event to update tab caption after you modify your business objects.
5. Declare a [ASPxPageControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxPageControl) private instance in your controller.
6. Handle the **CompositeView.LayoutManager.PageControlCreated** event and access **ASPxPageControl** as demonstrated in this example: [How to access a tab control in a Detail View layout](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/XAF_how-to-access-a-tab-control-in-a-detail-view-layout-e372). Save the control instance to your private property.
7. Loop through ASPxPageControl tabs in the ASPxGridView.DataBound event handler and update their captions based on the item count returned by the [CollectionSourceBase.GetCount](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.CollectionSourceBase.GetCount) method.
