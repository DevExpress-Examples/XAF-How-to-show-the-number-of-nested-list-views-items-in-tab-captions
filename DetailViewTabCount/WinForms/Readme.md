# XAF - How to show the number of a nested ListView's items in tab captions

In this example, we demonstrate how to show the number of nested ListViews' items in tab captions in WinForms applications. This is done in the platfrom-dependent controller: [EmployeeDetailViewWinController.cs](./CS/DetailViewTabCount.Module.Win/Controllers/EmployeeDetailViewWinController.cs). Follow the steps listed below to accomplish this task:

1. Create a controller in the WinForms module project.
2. To activate this controller only in particular Detail Views, specify its **TargetViewId** property.
3. In the **OnActivated** method, set the [CompositeView.DelayedItemsInitialization](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.CompositeView.DelayedItemsInitialization) to **false** to initialize all View Item controls immediately when the Detail View is created. This is required to access a nested ListView when its tab page is created.
4. In the same method, handle the **WinLayoutManager.ItemCreated** event.
5. Create a controller for Nested ListViews. To activate it, override the **OnFrameAssigned** method and add a reason to the **Active** collecion by checking the **Frame.Context** value. The controller should only be activated when this property' value is equal to **TemplateContext.NestedFrame**.
6. In the **OnActivated** method of the controller created in the previous step, handle CollectionsSource's [CollectionReloaded](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.CollectionSourceBase.CollectionReloaded), [CollectionChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.CollectionSourceBase.CollectionChanged) and the [XPBaseCollection.ListChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/XPO/DevExpress.Xpo.XPBaseCollection.ListChanged) events. In these event handlers, update tab captions using the [BaseLayoutItem.Text](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraLayout.BaseLayoutItem.Text) property.
7. Create the **Initialize** method with the LayoutGroup parameter. In this method, update a tab caption for a particular tab.
8. In the **WinLayoutManager.ItemCreated** event handler created in step 4, loop through the tabbed groups. Then, find **ListPropertyEditor**s using the [CompositeView.FindItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.CompositeView.FindItem(System.String)) method and get nested ListViews' controllers using the [Frame.GetController](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.Frame.GetController--1) method. Then, call the **Initialize** method created in the previous step.
